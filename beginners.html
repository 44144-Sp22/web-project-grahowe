    <p>Picture yourself in the worst situation possible. The power is out, there's
      no cell phone service, and the internet is out indefinitely. What would you do?
      Who would you call? Where would you go?</p>
    <p>The above scenario may never happen, but it's a good idea to believe that it will.
      As an amateur radio operator, you're ahead of the game. And in times of normalcy, ham
      radio can provide you with hours and hours of fun! There are so many activites to do
      as an amateur radio operator. Below are some examples of what you can do. Because amateur radio
      is evolving with new technology, the sky is the limit when it comes to activities!</p>
    <h3>Make friends and connections</h3>
    <p>Amateur radio can connect people who are miles apart from each other. You may have something
      in common! You may even form a lifelong friendship with someone on the other side, and you can
      even learn a new language. Operators are always willing to share tips and tricks, so don't forget
      to ask during your conversations about any advice. You may also get an elmer, or a person who acts
      as a mentor.</p>
    <h3>Talk to outer space</h3>
    <p>Astronaut Owen Garriot, W5LFL, was the first astronaut to bring amateur radio to space.
      Almost 40 years later, amateur radio remains prevalent in space exploration. On the
      Internationl Space Station, the astronauts aboard use various amateur radio equipment to talk
      to individuals and even students in schools across the globe. There are also several satellites
      no bigger than cell phones that are used to provide amateurs with scientific data. Below is an
      image from the ISS during a slow-scan television event. This is an amateur radio activity which
      allows individuals to receive images from the space station.</p>

    <h3>Build your own equipment</h3>
    <p>One of the best parts of amateur radio is building your own equipment. Amateur radio can help you
      learn about science, computers, electrionics, physics, and so much more! It can also help teach you
      the basics of electronics and soldering. If you like DIYing, ham radio is for you. There are no instructions
      when it comes to building your own equipment. All you really need is some basic knowledge, the right tools,
      and a creative imagination. So what will you build?</p>
    <h3>Contests and other activities</h3>
    <p>Many, if not all amateurs participate in activities within the hobby. These can include:
      <ul>
        <li>Fox Hunting: This is similar to a scavenger hunt. It is done using direction-finding techniques
          and specially-built antennas. If you've heard of Geocaching, Fox Hunting is quite similar.</li>
        <li>Contesting: This activity requires you to make the most calls in a given time period, generally 24 hours.
          You receive points based on how many calls you log, and you can receive bonus points for different countries
          received, your operating power, and sometimes your mode of choice.</li>
        <li>Organizational contests: Organizations such as the ARRL will host contests throughout the year. Examples of the
          ARRL&#39;s contests include RTTY Roundup, International Digital Contest, and even Kids Day, which is a day dedicated
          to the younger hams out on the air.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>There is so much to do as a ham radio operator, and this is just the beginning! Check out our resources page to find
      out how you can get involved and get on the air!</p>
