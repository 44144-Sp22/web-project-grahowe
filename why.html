      <h2>Why do amateur radio?</h2>
      <p>Amateur radio, or ham radio, is a century old science experiment. It is made
        up of many individuals who come from all walks of life. Whether you are a
        college student, a doctor, black, or white, you too can become an amateur radio
        operator! All you need to do is take a test that is given by your regulatory
        agency (The Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC in the United States).
        Once you pass the test, you will be given certain frequency privileges. For example,
        a Technician has very limited privileges in comparison to a General or an Extra class.
        You may take more tests in order to earn more frequency privileges and more operating
        opportunities.</p><br>
      <h2>What can you do?</h2>
      <p>As an amateur radio operator, the sky is the limit! With a license, you can talk
      to someone halfway across the globe, talk to an astronaut on the International Space
      Station, participate in storm chasing through programs like SkyWarn, Start a local community
      club, and so much more!</p><br>
      <h2>How to get started?</h2>
      <p>For more information, go to our resources page and head on over to the ARRL website. You can
        find out when you can take an amateur radio exam locally. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, in
        some instances, you may be able to take an online proctored test.</p>
      <p>So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and give ham radio a try! It's fun, a lifelong hobby, and
      the opportunities are endless!</p>
