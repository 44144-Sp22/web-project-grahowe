    <h2>Why do amateur radio?</h2>
    <p>Amateur radio, or ham radio, is a century old science experiment. It is made
      up of many individuals who come from all walks of life. Whether you are a
      college student, a doctor, black, or white, you too can become an amateur radio
      operator! All you need to do is take a test that is given by your regulatory
      agency (The Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC in the United States).
    <h2>What can you do?</h2>
    <p>As an amateur radio operator, the sky is the limit! With a license, you can:</p>
    <ul>
